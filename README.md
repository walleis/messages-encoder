Caesar Cipher
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher, a Python program that implements one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques! This tool lets you encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions (the "key"). Perfect for learning about basic cryptography or just having some fun with secret messages.

How It Works
The user chooses whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The user inputs the message they want to process.
The user provides a shift key (a number between 1 and 25) to determine how far each letter shifts.
The program outputs the resulting encrypted or decrypted text, preserving non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation).

Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system. No external libraries are required since this uses only built-in Python features.

Installation
Download or clone this repository to your computer.
Confirm Python is installed by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.
Run the program by opening a terminal in the project folder and typing:
python caesar_cipher.py
